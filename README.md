## packageRank: compute and visualize package download counts and rank percentiles

[`'packageRank'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=packageRank)’ is an
R package that helps put package download counts into context. It does
so via two functions, `cranDownloads()` and `packageRank()`.

`cranDownloads()` extends
[`cranlogs::cran_downloads()`](http://r-hub.github.io/cranlogs/) package
by adding a `plot()` method and a more user-friendly interface to the
task of counting package downloads. `packageRank()` uses rank
percentiles, a nonparametric statistic that tells you the percentage of
packages with fewer downloads, to help you see how your package is doing
compared to all other packages on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).

NOTE: ‘packageRank’ relies on the ‘cranlogs’ package and requires an
active internet connection. RStudio CRAN logs for the previous day are
generally posted at 18:00 (GMT+1) or 17:00 UTC (GMT+2) (daylight saving
time); results for functions that rely on ‘cranlogs’ are available soon
after.

### I - getting started

To install ‘packageRank’ from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("packageRank")
```

To install the development version from
GitHub:

``` r
# You may need to first install 'remotes' via install.packages("remotes").
remotes::install_github("lindbrook/packageRank", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### II - computing package download counts

`cranDownloads()` uses all the same arguments as
`cranlogs::cran_downloads()`:

``` r
cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = "HistData")
```

    >         date count  package
    > 1 2020-05-01   338 HistData

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData")
```

    >         date count  package
    > 1 2020-05-01   338 HistData

The only difference is that `cranDownloads()` adds three features:

#### i) check package names

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "GGplot2")
```

    ## Error in cranDownloads(packages = "GGplot2") :
    ##   GGplot2: misspelled or not on CRAN.

<br/>

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "ggplot2")
```

    >         date count package
    > 1 2020-05-01 56357 ggplot2

<br/> This also works for inactive or “retired” packages in the
[Archive](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive):

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "vr")
```

    ## Error in cranDownloads(packages = "vr") :
    ##  vr: misspelled or not on CRAN/Archive.

<br/>

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "VR")
```

    >         date count package
    > 1 2020-05-01    11      VR

<br/>

#### ii) two additional date formats

With `cranlogs::cran_downloads()`, you specify a time frame using the
`from` and `to` arguments. The downside of this is that dates must use
the “yyyy-mm-dd” format. For convenience’s sake and to reduce typing,
`cranDownloads()` also allows you to use “yyyy-mm” or “yyyy” (yyyy also
works).

##### “yyyy-mm”

Let’s say you want the download counts for
[`'HistData'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=HistData) from
February 2020. With `cranlogs::cran_downloads()`, you have to type out
the whole date and remember that 2020 was a leap year:

``` r
cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2020-02-01",
  to = "2020-02-29")
```

<br/> With `cranDownloads()`, you can just specify the year and month:

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2020-02", to = "2020-02")
```

##### “yyyy”

Let’s say you want the year-to-date download counts for
[`'rstan'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstan). With
`cranlogs::cran_downloads()`, you’d type something like:

``` r
cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2020-01-01",
  to = Sys.Date() - 1)
```

<br/> With `cranDownloads()`, you can just type:

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2020")
```

<br/>

#### iii) check dates

`cranDownloads()` tries to check for valid dates:

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2019-01-15",
  to = "2019-01-35")
```

    ## Error in resolveDate(to, type = "to") : Not a valid date.

<br/>

### III - visualizing package downloads

`cranDownloads()` makes visualization easy. Just use
`plot()`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2019", to = "2019"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cranDownloads_viz1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

If you pass a vector of package names for a single day, `plot()` returns
a dotchart:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020-03-01", to = "2020-03-01"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cranDownloads_viz2a-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

If you pass a vector of package names, `plot()` will use `ggplot2`
facets:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cranDownloads_viz2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
<br/>

If you want to plot those data in a single frame, use `multi.plot =
TRUE`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), multi.plot = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-cranDownloads_viz3-1.png)<!-- -->

<br/> If you want separate plots, use `graphics = "base"` (you’ll be
prompted for each plot):

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), graphics = "base")
```

If you want separate, independently scaled plots, add `same.xy = FALSE`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), graphics = "base", same.xy = FALSE)
```

#### `packages = NULL`

`cranlogs::cran_download(packages = NULL)` computes the total number of
package downloads from CRAN.

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(from = 2019, to = 2019))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

#### `packages = "R"`

`cranlogs::cran_download(packages = "R")` computes the total number of
downloads of the R application (note that you can only use “R” or a
vector of packages names, not both\!).

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "R", from = 2019, to = 2019))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

#### smoothers and confidence intervals

To add a lowess smoother to your data, use `smooth = TRUE`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2019", to = "2019"),
  smooth = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

With graphs that use ‘ggplot2’, `se = TRUE` will add confidence
intervals:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("HistData", "rnaturalearth", "Zelig"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), smooth = TRUE, se = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

#### package and R release dates

To annotate a graph with package release dates:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2019", to = "2019"),
  package.version = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

To annotate a graph with R release dates:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2019", to = "2019"),
  r.version = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

#### population plot

To visualize a package’s downloads relative to “all” other packages over
time:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"),
  population.plot = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

This longitudinal view plots the date (x-axis) against the logarithm of
a package’s downloads (y-axis). In the background, the same variable are
plotted (in gray) for a stratified random sample of packages: within
each 5% interval of rank percentiles (e.g., 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 95 to 100,
etc.), a random sample of 5% of packages is selected and tracked over
time. This sample approximates the “typical” pattern of downloads for
that time period.

### IV - computing package download rank percentiles

After looking the download count data for a while, the “compared to
what?” question will quickly come to mind. For instance, consider the
data for the first week of March 2020:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "cholera", from = "2020-03-01",
  to = "2020-03-07"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-motivation_code-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Do Wednesday and Saturday reflect surges of interest in the package or
surges of traffic to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)? To put it
differently, how can we know if a given download count is typical or
unusual?

One way to answer these questions is to locate your package in the
frequency distribution of download counts. Below are the distributions
for Wednesday and Saturday with the location of
[`'cholera'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cholera)
highlighted:

<img src="man/figures/README-skew_wed-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<img src="man/figures/README-skew_sat-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

As you can see, the frequency distribution of package downloads
typically has a heavily skewed, exponential shape. On the Wednesday, the
most “popular” package had 177,745 downloads while the least “popular”
package(s) had just one. This is why the left side of the distribution,
where packages with fewer downloads are located, *looks* like a vertical
line.

To see what’s going on, I take the log of download counts (x-axis) and
redraw the graph. In these plots, the location of a vertical segment
along the x-axis represents a download count and the height of a
vertical segment represents the frequency of a download
count:

``` r
plot(packageDistribution(package = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-packageDistribution_wed_code-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
plot(packageDistribution(package = "cholera", date = "2020-03-07"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-packageDistribution_sat_code-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

While these plots give us a better picture of where
[`'cholera'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cholera) is located,
comparisons between Wednesday and Saturday are impressionistic at best:
all we can confidently say is that the download counts for both days
were greater than the mode.

To facilitate interpretation and comparison, I use the *rank percentile*
of download counts in place of nominal download counts. This
nonparametric statistic tells you the percentage of packages with fewer
downloads. In other words, it gives you the location of your package
relative to the locations of all other packages. More importantly, by
rescaling download counts to lie on the bounded interval between 0 and
100, rank percentiles make it easier to compare packages within and
across distributions.

For example, we can compare Wednesday (“2020-03-04”) to Saturday
(“2020-03-07”):

``` r
packageRank(package = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04", size.filter = FALSE)
>         date packages downloads            rank percentile
> 1 2020-03-04  cholera        38 5,556 of 18,038       67.9
```

On Wednesday, we can see that
[`'cholera'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cholera) had 38
downloads, came in 5,556th place out of 18,038 unique packages
downloaded, and earned a spot in the 68th
percentile.

``` r
packageRank(package = "cholera", date = "2020-03-07", size.filter = FALSE)
>         date packages downloads            rank percentile
> 1 2020-03-07  cholera        29 3,061 of 15,950         80
```

On Saturday, we can see that
[`'cholera'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cholera) had 29
downloads, came in 3,061st place out of 15,950 unique packages
downloaded, earned a spot in the 80th percentile.

So contrary to what the nominal counts tell us, one could say that the
interest in [`'cholera'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cholera)
was actually greater on Saturday than on Wednesday.

#### computing rank percentile

To compute rank percentiles, I do the following. For each package, I
tabulate the number of downloads and then compute the percentage of
packages with fewer downloads. Here are the details using
[`'cholera'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cholera) from Wednesday
as an example:

``` r
pkg.rank <- packageRank(packages = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04",
  size.filter = FALSE)

downloads <- pkg.rank$crosstab

round(100 * mean(downloads < downloads["cholera"]), 1)
> [1] 67.9
```

To put it differently:

``` r
(pkgs.with.fewer.downloads <- sum(downloads < downloads["cholera"]))
> [1] 12250

(tot.pkgs <- length(downloads))
> [1] 18038

round(100 * pkgs.with.fewer.downloads / tot.pkgs, 1)
> [1] 67.9
```

For the example above, 38 downloads puts ‘HistData’ in 5,556th place
among the 18,038 packages downloaded.

This rank is “nominal” because multiple packages can have the same
number of downloads. As a result, a package’s nominal rank (but not its
rank percentile) can be affected by its name: packages with the same
number of downloads are sorted in alphabetical order.

Thus, ‘HistData’ benefits from the fact that it is 31st in the list of
263 packages with 38 downloads:

``` r
pkg.rank <- packageRank(packages = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04",
  size.filter = FALSE)
downloads <- pkg.rank$crosstab

which(names(downloads[downloads == 38]) == "cholera")
> [1] 31
length(downloads[downloads == 38])
> [1] 263
```

### V - visualizing package download rank percentiles

To visualize `packageRank()`, use
`plot()`.

``` r
plot(packageRank(packages = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-packageRank_plot_code_wed-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<br/>

``` r
plot(packageRank(packages = "cholera", date = "2020-03-07"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-packageRank_plot_code_sat-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

These graphs, customized to be on the same scale, plot the *rank order*
of packages’ download counts (x-axis) against the logarithm of those
counts (y-axis). It then highlights a package’s position in the
distribution along with its rank percentile and download count (in red).
In the background, the 75th, 50th and 25th percentiles are plotted as
dotted vertical lines; the package with the most downloads, which in
both cases is
[`'magrittr'`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=magrittr) (in blue,
top left); and the total number of downloads, 5,561,681 and 3,403,969
respectively (in blue, top right).

### VI - filter “small” downloads

`packageRank()` and `packageLog()` have an additional argument,
‘size.filter’ that by removes downloads \< 1000 bytes. Depending on
the day of the week and the number of versions a package has, this can
provide a more accurate count of package downloads. For example, here is
a raw download
count:

``` r
packageRank(packages = "HistData", date = "2019-10-30", size.filter = FALSE)
>         date packages downloads          rank percentile
> 1 2019-10-30 HistData       403 794 of 17,396       95.4
```

Below is a filtered
count.

``` r
packageRank(packages = "HistData", date = "2019-10-30", size.filter = TRUE)
>         date packages downloads          rank percentile
> 1 2019-10-30 HistData       382 796 of 15,330       94.8
```

Besides a difference of 21 downloads, notice that the number of unique
packages downloaded falls from 17,396 to 15,330.

By default, `size.filter = TRUE` for `packageRank()` and `size.filter =
FALSE` for `packageLog()`.

### VII - memoization

To avoid the bottleneck of downloading multiple log files,
`packageRank()` is currently limited to individual days or observations.
However, to reduce the need to re-download logs, ‘packageRank’ makes use
of memoization via the ‘memoise’ package.

Here’s relevant code:

``` r
fetchLog <- function(url) data.table::fread(url)

mfetchLog <- memoise::memoise(fetchLog)

if (RCurl::url.exists(url)) {
  cran_log <- mfetchLog(url)
}

# Note that data.table::fread() relies on R.utils::decompressFile().
```

If you use `fetchLog()`, the log file, which can be upwards of 50 MB,
will be downloaded every time you call the function. If you use
`mfetchLog()`, logs are intelligently cached; those that have already
been downloaded, in your current R session, will not be downloaded
again.
