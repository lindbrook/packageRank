## packageRank: compute and visualize package download counts and rank percentiles

### Features

  - compute and visualize the counts and ranks (nominal and percentile)
    of downloads from RStudio’s [CRAN
    mirror](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com) and
    [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/).
  - compute and visualize a package’s position in the overall
    distribution of download counts for a given day (cross-sectionally)
    or over time (longitudinally).
  - compute and visualize the downloads of the R application.

NOTE: ‘packageRank’ relies on the ‘cranlogs’ package and an active
internet connection. RStudio CRAN logs for the previous day are
generally posted at 18:00 (GMT+1) or 17:00 UTC (GMT+2); results for
functions that rely on ‘cranlogs’ are available soon after.

### Getting started

To install ‘packageRank’ from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("packageRank")
```

To install the latest development version from
GitHub:

``` r
# You may need to first install the 'remotes' via install.packages("remotes").
remotes::install_github("lindbrook/packageRank", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### I - Background

The ‘[cranlogs](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cranlogs)’ package
computes the number of downloads, packages and R itself, from RStudio’s
[CRAN mirror](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com).

For example, we can see that on the first day of 2019 the
‘[HistData](https://cran.r-project.org/package=HistData)’ package was
downloaded 51
times:

``` r
cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2019-01-01", to = "2019-01-01")
>         date count  package
> 1 2019-01-01    51 HistData
```

Lurking in the background is the “compared to what?” question. Is 51
downloads large or small? The objective of ‘packageRank’ is to help
answer such questions by putting counts into context.

### II - Computation of downloads

To compute package or R downloads, use `cranDownloads()`. In contrast to
`cranlogs::cran_downloads()`, `cranDownloads()` offers more convenient
interface. You can pass dates as “yyyy-mm-dd”, “yyyy-mm” or “yyyy”:

``` r
# Downloads from December 31, 2018 through June 25, 2019
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2018-12-31", to = "2019-06-25")

# Downloads from June 2015 through June 2019
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2015-06", to = "2016-01")

# 2015 to 2019
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2015", to = "2019")

# Year-to-date
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2019")
```

To compute the downloads for multiple packages, pass a character vector
of package names.

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = c("Rcpp", "rlang", "data.table"))
```

### III - Visualization of downloads

When dealing with many observations (e.g., longer time series),
visualization can be useful. To do so, use `cranDownloads()`’s plot
method:

``` r
# Downloads from December 31, 2018 throught June 25, 2019
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2018-12-31", to = "2019-06-25"))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Downloads from June 2015 through June 2019
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2015-06", to = "2016-01"))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# 2015 to 2019  (either character or numeric are OK)
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2015", to = "2019"))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Year-to-date
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2019"))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

#### multiple packages

When you pass a vector of multiple packages, you’ll get a dot chart for
a single date and a ‘ggplot2’ figure with multiple facets for multiple
dates:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("Rcpp", "rlang", "data.table"), from = "2019-01-01", to = "2019-01-01"))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("Rcpp", "rlang", "data.table"), when = "last-month"))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-2.png)<!-- -->

If you want separate plots for each package, set the ‘graphics’ argument
to
“base”:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("Rcpp", "rlang", "data.table"), when = "last-month"), graphics = "base")
```

#### no packages

When you don’t pass any packages (i.e., packages = NULL), you’ll get a
count of the total package downloads from CRAN.

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(from = 2019, to = 2019))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

#### R as a “package”

When you pass “R”, you’ll get a count of total downloads of the R
application.

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "R", from = 2019, to = 2019))
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

#### smoothers, confidence intervals, and R release dates

You can also plot a smoother with the ‘smooth’ argument and release
dates for R with the ‘r.version’
argument:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2019"), smooth = TRUE, r.version = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

With ‘ggplot2’ figures, the ‘se’ argument adds confidence
intervals:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("HistData", "rnaturalearth", "Zelig"), when = "last-month"),
  smooth = TRUE, se = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Bioconductor

For Bioconductor packages, use `bioconductorDownloads()`. Note that
because logs are aggregated to the month or calendar year, dates must
either be “yyyy-mm” or “yyyy”:

``` r
# Downloads from June 2015 through June 2019
plot(bioconductorDownloads(packages = "monocle", from = "2015-06", to = "2019-06"))
```

![](man/figures/README-bioconductorDownloads-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r

# Year-to-date
plot(bioconductorDownloads(packages = "monocle", from = "2019"))
```

![](man/figures/README-bioconductorDownloads-2.png)<!-- -->

Because of the aggregation, red squares are used to indicate in-progress
observations.

### IV - Computing percentiles and ranks

One way to put download counts into context is to compute its rank
percentile. This statistic, familiar to those who’ve taken a
standardized test, tell us the packages had fewer downloads. In this
way, the rank percentile give us an idea of a package’s place in the
overall distribution of downloads. To compute this statistic, use
`packageRank()`:

``` r
packageRank(packages = "HistData", date = "2019-01-01")
>         date packages downloads percentile          rank
> 1 2019-01-01 HistData        51       93.4 915 of 14,020
```

Here, we see that 51 downloads on January 1, 2019 put ‘HistData’ in the
93rd percentile: 93% of packages had fewer downloads than ‘HistData’.

Because packages with zero downloads are not recorded in the log, there
is a potential censoring problem. However, my analysis indicates that
the number of packages on CRAN without any downloads on a given day is
actually pretty small. In fact, the number of archived packages, not on
CRAN, that are downloaded is often pretty high.

#### Filter downloads by size

Note that with ‘packageRank’ (\> 0.3.0.9002), packageRank() has an
additional argument, ‘filter’, that by default removes downloads \< 1000
bytes. Depending on the day of the week and the number of versions a
package has, this can provide a more accurate count of pacakge downloads
(details forthcoming). For example, here is a raw download
count:

``` r
packageRank(packages = "HistData", date = "2019-10-30", size.filter = FALSE)
>         date packages downloads percentile          rank
> 1 2019-10-30 HistData       403       95.4 794 of 17,396
```

Below is a filtered
count.

``` r
packageRank(packages = "HistData", date = "2019-10-30", size.filter = TRUE)
>         date packages downloads percentile          rank
> 1 2019-10-30 HistData       382       94.8 796 of 15,330
```

Besides a difference of 21 downloads, notice that the number of unique
packages downloaded falls from 17,396 to 15,330.

#### computing rank percentile

To compute the rank percentile, I tabulate the number of downloads per
package recorded in the log. Then for a given download count, I compute
the percentage of packages with fewer download counts:

``` r
pkg.rank <- packageRank(packages = "HistData", date = "2019-01-01")
downloads <- pkg.rank$crosstab

round(100 * mean(downloads < downloads["HistData"]), 1)
> [1] 93.4

# OR

(pkgs.with.fewer.downloads <- sum(downloads < downloads["HistData"]))
> [1] 13097

(tot.pkgs <- length(downloads))
> [1] 14020

round(100 * pkgs.with.fewer.downloads / tot.pkgs, 1)
> [1] 93.4
```

For the example above, 51 downloads puts ‘HistData’ in 920th place among
the 14,020 packages downloaded. This rank is “nominal” because multiple
packages can have the same number of downloads. As a result, a package’s
nominal rank (but not its rank percentile) can be affected by its name:
packages with the same number of downloads are sorted in alphabetical
order. Thus, ‘HistData’ benefits from the fact that it is second in the
list of packages with 51 downloads:

``` r
pkg.rank <- packageRank(packages = "HistData", date = "2019-01-01")
downloads <- pkg.rank$crosstab

downloads[downloads == 51]
>
>  dynamicTreeCut        HistData         modeest  NeuralNetTools   OpenStreetMap
>              51              51              51              51              51
>       pkgKitten plotlyGeoAssets         superpc           sweep        webutils
>              51              51              51              51              51
```

#### Bioconductor

For Bioconductor packages, use `bioconductorRank()`:

``` r
bioconductorRank(packages = "cicero", date = "2019-09")
>      date packages downloads percentile         rank
> 1 2019-09   cicero       171       77.8 434 of 1,954
```

### V - Visualizing percentiles and ranks (cross-sectional)

To visualize the rank percentile, use `packageRank()`’s plot
method:

``` r
plot(packageRank(packages = "HistData", date = "2019-01-01"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot1a-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" />

This provides a cross-sectional view that plots a package’s rank
(x-axis) against the base 10 logarithm of its downloads (y-axis), and
highlights the package’s position in the overall distribution of
downloads. In addition, the plot illustrates 1) a package’s rank
percentile and raw count of downloads (in red); 2) the location of the
75th, 50th and 25th percentiles (dotted gray vertical lines); 3) the
package with the most downloads, in this case ‘WGCNA’ (in blue, top
left); and 4) the total number of downloads (2,982,767 for CRAN) (in
blue, top right).

You can also do this with
`bioconductorRank()`:

``` r
plot(bioconductorRank(packages = "cicero", date = "2019-01"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot2b-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" />

And you can also pass a vector of
packages:

``` r
plot(packageRank(packages = c("cholera", "HistData", "regtools"), date = "2019-01-01"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot2a-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" />

### VI - Visualizing percentiles and ranks (longitudinal)

To visualize a package’s relative position over time, use
`packageRankTime()`:

``` r
plot(packageRankTime(packages = "HistData", when = "last-month"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-plot_ts-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto auto auto 0;" />

This longitudinal view plots the date (x-axis) against the logarithm of
a package’s downloads (y-axis).

In the background, the same variable are plotted (in gray) for a
stratified random sample of packages: within each 5% interval of rank
percentiles (e.g., 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 95 to 100, etc.), a random sample of
5% of packages is selected and tracked over time. This sample
approximates the “typical” pattern of downloads for that time period.

Note: only two time frames are currently available: “last-week” and
“last-month”. Also, a version for
[Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/) packages is not currently
available.

### VII Graphics: base R and ‘ggplot2’

Plots are available as both base R and ‘ggplot2’ graphs. By default,
plots for one package or day use base graphics while those with multiple
packages or days use ‘ggplot2’. You can override these defaults by using
the “graphics” argument in the `plot()` method.

### VIII - Memoization

To avoid the bottleneck of downloading multiple log files,
`packageRank()` is currently limited to individual days or observations.
However, to reduce the need to re-download logs for a given day,
‘packageRank’ makes use of memoization via the ‘memoise’ package.

Here’s relevant code:

``` r
fetchLog <- function(x) data.table::fread(x)

mfetchLog <- memoise::memoise(fetchLog)

if (RCurl::url.exists(url)) {
  cran_log <- mfetchLog(url)
}
```

If you use `fetchLog()`, the log file, which can sometimes be as large
as 50 MB, will be downloaded every time you call the function. If you
use `mfetchLog()`, logs are intelligently cached; those that have
already been downloaded, in your current R session, will not be
downloaded again.
