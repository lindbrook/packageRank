## packageRank: compute and visualize package download counts and rank percentiles

[‘packageRank’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=packageRank) is an R
package that helps put package download counts into context. It does so
via two core functions, `cranDownloads()` and `packageRank()`, a set of
filters that reduce download count inflation, and a host of other
assorted functions.

You can read more about the package the sections below:

- [I Download Counts](#i---download-counts) describes how
  `cranDownloads()` gives
  [`cranlogs::cran_downloads()`](https://r-hub.github.io/cranlogs/reference/cran_downloads.html)
  a more user-friendly interface, and how it makes visualizing those
  data easy (via a generic R `plot()` method).
- [II Download Rank Percentiles](#ii---download-rank-percentiles)
  describes how `packageRank()` makes use of rank percentiles. This
  nonparametric statistic computes the percentage of packages that with
  fewer downloads than yours (e.g., your package is in the 74th
  percentile). This facilitates comparison and helps you to locate your
  package in the overall distribution of
  [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/) package downloads.
- [III Inflation Filters](#iii---inflation-filters) describes the five
  different filter functions used to remove software and behavioral
  artifacts that inflate *nominal* download counts. This functionality
  is offered in `packageRank()` and `packageLog()` but *not*, for
  computational reasons, in `cranDownloads()`.
- [IV Availability of Results](#iv---availability-of-results) discusses
  when results become available, how to use `logInfo()` to check the
  availability of today’s results, and the effect of time zones.
- [V Data Fix A](#v---data-fix-a) discusses issues stemming from
  problems with the actual logs from the end of 2012 through the
  beginning of 2013. These are fixed in `fixDate_2012()` and
  `fixCranlogs()`.
- [VI Data Fix B](#vi---data-fix-b) discusses a “doubling” of R
  application download counts stemming from problems with
  [‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) between
  2023-09-13 through 2023-10-02. This is fixed in `fixRCranlogs()`.
- [VII et cetera](#vii---et-cetera) discusses country code top-level
  domains (e.g., `countryPackage()` and `packageCountry()`), the use of
  memoization, the internet connection time out problem, and the spikes
  in the download of the Windows version of the R application on Sundays
  and Wednesdays between 06 November 2022 and 19 March 2023.

### getting started

To install
[‘packageRank’](https://cran.r-project.org/package=packageRank) from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/):

``` r
install.packages("packageRank")
```

To install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# You may need to first install 'remotes' via install.packages("remotes").
remotes::install_github("lindbrook/packageRank", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### I - download counts

`cranDownloads()` uses all the same arguments as
`cranlogs::cran_downloads()`:

``` r
cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = "HistData")
```

    >         date count  package
    > 1 2020-05-01   338 HistData

The only difference is that `cranDownloads()` adds four features:

#### i) “spell check” for package names

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "GGplot2")
```

    ## Error in cranDownloads(packages = "GGplot2") :
    ##   GGplot2: misspelled or not on CRAN.

<br/>

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "ggplot2")
```

    >         date count cumulative package
    > 1 2020-05-01 56357      56357 ggplot2

<br/> Note that his also works for inactive or “retired” packages in the
[Archive](https://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/):

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "vr")
```

    ## Error in cranDownloads(packages = "vr") :
    ##  vr: misspelled or not on CRAN/Archive.

<br/>

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "VR")
```

    >         date count cumulative package
    > 1 2020-05-01    11         11      VR

<br/>

#### ii) two additional date formats

With `cranlogs::cran_downloads()`, you specify a time frame using the
`from` and `to` arguments. The downside of this is that you *must* use
“yyyy-mm-dd”. For convenience’s sake, `cranDownloads()` also allows you
to use “yyyy-mm” or yyyy (“yyyy” also works).

##### “yyyy-mm”

Let’s say you want the download counts for
[‘HistData’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=HistData) for February
2020. With `cranlogs::cran_downloads()`, you’d have to type out the
whole date and remember that 2020 was a leap year:

``` r
cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2020-02-01",
  to = "2020-02-29")
```

<br/> With `cranDownloads()`, you can just specify the year and month:

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2020-02", to = "2020-02")
```

##### yyyy or “yyyy”

Let’s say you want the download counts for
[‘rstan’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rstan) for 2020. With
`cranlogs::cran_downloads()`, you’d type something like:

``` r
cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2022-01-01",
  to = "2022-12-31")
```

<br/> With `cranDownloads()`, you can use:

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = 2020, to = 2020)
```

or

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2020", to = "2020")
```

<br/>

#### iii) shortcuts with `from =` and `to =` in `cranDownloads()`

These additional date formats help to create convenient shortcuts. Let’s
say you want the year-to-date download counts for
[‘rstan’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rstan). With
`cranlogs::cran_downloads()`, you’d type something like:

``` r
cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2023-01-01",
  to = Sys.Date() - 1)
```

<br/> With `cranDownloads()`, you can just pass the current year to
`from =`:

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = 2023)
```

And if you wanted the entire download history, pass the current year to
`to =`:

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", to = 2023)
```

Note that because the Posit/RStudio logs begin on 01 October 2012,
download data for packages published before that date are unavailable.

#### iv) check date validity

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2019-01-15",
  to = "2019-01-35")
```

    ## Error in resolveDate(to, type = "to") : Not a valid date.

#### v) cumulative count for selected time frame

``` r
cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", when = "last-week")
```

    >         date count cumulative  package
    > 1 2020-05-01   338        338 HistData
    > 2 2020-05-02   259        597 HistData
    > 3 2020-05-03   321        918 HistData
    > 4 2020-05-04   344       1262 HistData
    > 5 2020-05-05   324       1586 HistData
    > 6 2020-05-06   356       1942 HistData
    > 7 2020-05-07   324       2266 HistData

<br/>

### visualizing package download counts

`cranDownloads()` makes visualizing package downloads easy. Just use
`plot()`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2019", to = "2019"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cranDownloads_viz1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

If you pass a vector of package names for a single day, `plot()` returns
a dotchart:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020-03-01", to = "2020-03-01"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cranDownloads_viz2a-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

If you pass a vector of package names for multiple days, `plot()` uses
[‘ggplot2’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggplot2) facets:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cranDownloads_viz2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
<br/>

To plot those data in a single frame, set `multi.plot = TRUE`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), multi.plot = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-cranDownloads_viz3-1.png)<!-- -->

<br/> To plot those data in separate plots on the same scale, set
`graphics = "base"` and you’ll be prompted for each plot:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), graphics = "base")
```

To do the above on separate, independent scales, set `same.xy = FALSE`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), graphics = "base", same.xy = FALSE)
```

#### logarithm of download counts

To use the base 10 logarithm of the download count in a plot, set
`log.y = TRUE`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2019", to = "2019"),
  log.y = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-log_count-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that for the sake of the plot, zero counts are replaced by ones so
that the logarithm can be computed (This does not affect the data
returned by `cranDownloads()`).

#### `packages = NULL`

`cranlogs::cran_download(packages = NULL)` computes the total number of
package downloads from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). You can plot
these data by using:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(from = 2019, to = 2019))
```

![](man/figures/README-null_packages-1.png)<!-- -->

#### `packages = "R"`

`cranlogs::cran_download(packages = "R")` computes the total number of
downloads of the R application (note that you can only use “R” or a
vector of packages names, not both!). You can plot these data by using:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "R", from = 2019, to = 2019))
```

![](man/figures/README-r_downloads-1.png)<!-- -->

If you want the total count of R downloads, set `r.total = TRUE`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "R", from = 2019, to = 2019), r.total = TRUE)
```

Note that since Sunday 06 November 2022 and Wednesday, 18 January 2023,
there’ve been spikes of downloads of the Windows version of R on Sundays
and Wednesdays (details below in [R Windows Sunday and Wednesday
downloads](#r-windows-sunday-and-wednesday-downloads)).

#### smoothers and confidence intervals

To add a lowess smoother to your plot, use `smooth = TRUE`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2019", to = "2019"),
  smooth = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-lowess-1.png)<!-- -->

With graphs that use ‘ggplot2’, `se = TRUE` will add confidence
intervals:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("HistData", "rnaturalearth", "Zelig"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), smooth = TRUE, se = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-ci-1.png)<!-- -->

You can control the degree of smooth using the span argument (the
default is span = 0.75):

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("HistData", "rnaturalearth", "Zelig"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), smooth = TRUE, se = TRUE, span = 0.33)
```

#### package and R release dates

To annotate a graph with a package’s release dates:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2019", to = "2019"),
  package.version = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-pkg_release_date-1.png)<!-- -->

To annotate a graph with R release dates:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "rstan", from = "2019", to = "2019"),
  r.version = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-r_release_date-1.png)<!-- -->

#### plot growth curves (cumulative download counts)

To plot growth curves, set `statistic = "cumulative"`:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = c("ggplot2", "data.table", "Rcpp"),
  from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"), statistic = "cumulative",
  multi.plot = TRUE, points = FALSE)
```

![](man/figures/README-cranDownloads_growth_curves-1.png)<!-- -->

#### population plot

To visualize a package’s downloads relative to “all” other packages over
time:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "HistData", from = "2020", to = "2020-03-20"),
  population.plot = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-pop_plot_code-1.png)<!-- -->

This longitudinal view of package downloads plots the date (x-axis)
against the base 10 logarithm of the selected package’s downloads
(y-axis). To get a sense of how the selected package’s performance
stacks up against all other packages, a set of smoothed curves
representing a stratified random sample of packages is plotted in gray
in the background (the “typical” pattern of downloads on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) for the selected time period).
Specifically, within each 5% interval of rank percentiles (e.g., 0 to 5,
5 to 10, 95 to 100, etc.), a random sample of 5% of packages is selected
and tracked.

#### unit of observation

The unit of observation for both `cranDownloads()` and
`cranlogs::cran_dowanlods()` is the “day”. The graph below plots the
daily downloads for
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) from 01
January 2022 through 15 April 2022.

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "cranlogs", from = 2022, to = "2022-04-15"))
```

![](man/figures/README-day-1.png)<!-- -->

To view the data from a less granular perspective, set
plot.cranDownloads()’s `unit.observation` argument to “week”, “month”,
or “year”.

##### `unit.observation = "month"`

The graph below plots the data aggregated by month (with an added
smoother):

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "cranlogs", from = 2022, to = "2022-04-15"),
  unit.observation = "month", smooth = TRUE, graphics = "ggplot2")
```

![](man/figures/README-month-1.png)<!-- -->

Three things to note. First, if the last/current month (far right) is
still in-progress (it’s not the end of the month), that observation will
be split in two: one point for the in-progress total (empty black
square), another for the estimated total (empty red circle). The
estimate is based on the proportion of the month completed. In the
example above, the 635 observed downloads from April 1 through April 15
translates into an estimate of 1,270 downloads for the entire month (30
/ 15 \* 635). Second, if a smoother is included, it will only use
“complete”, not in-progress or estimated data. Third, all points are
plotted along the x-axis on the first day of the month.

##### `unit.observation = "week"`

The graph below plots the data aggregated by week (weeks begin on
Sunday).

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "cranlogs", from = 2022, to = "2022-06-15"),
  unit.observation = "week", smooth = TRUE)
```

![](man/figures/README-week-1.png)<!-- -->

Four things to note. First, if the first week (far left) is incomplete
(the ‘from’ date is not a Sunday), that observation will be split in
two: one point for the observed total on the nominal start date (gray
empty square) and another point for the *backdated* total. Backdating
involves completing the week by pushing the nominal start date back to
include the previous Sunday (blue asterisk). In the example above, the
nominal start date (01 January 2022) is moved back to include data
through the previous Sunday (26 December 2021). This is useful because
with a weekly unit of observation the first observation is likely to be
truncated and would not give the most representative picture of the
data. Second, if the last week (far right) is in-progress (the ‘to’ date
is not a Saturday), that observation will be split in two: the observed
total (gray empty square) and the estimated total based on the
proportion of week completed (red empty circle). Third, just like the
monthly plot, smoothers only use complete data, including backdated data
but excluding in-progress and estimated data. Fourth, with the exception
of first week’s observed count, which is plotted at its nominal date,
points are plotted along the x-axis on Sundays, the first day of the
week.

### II - download rank percentiles

After spending some time with nominal download counts, the “compared to
what?” question will come to mind. For instance, consider the data for
the ‘cholera’ package from the first week of March 2020:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(packages = "cholera", from = "2020-03-01",
  to = "2020-03-07"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-motivation_code-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Do Wednesday and Saturday reflect surges of interest in the package or
surges of traffic to [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/)? To put it
differently, how can we know if a given download count is typical or
unusual?

To answer these questions, we can start by looking at the total number
of package downloads:

``` r
plot(cranDownloads(from = "2020-03-01", to = "2020-03-07"))
```

![](man/figures/README-motivation_cran-1.png)<!-- -->

Here we see that there’s a big difference between the work week and the
weekend. This seems to indicate that the download activity for
[‘cholera’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cholera) on the weekend
seems high. Moreover, the Wednesday peak for
[‘cholera’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cholera) downloads seems
higher than the mid-week peak of total downloads.

One way to better address these observations is to locate your package’s
download counts in the overall frequency distribution of download
counts. ‘cholera’ allows you to do so via `packageDistribution()`. Below
are the distributions of logarithm of download counts for Wednesday and
Saturday. Each vertical segment (along the x-axis) represents a download
count. The height of a segment represents that download count’s
frequency. The location of
[‘cholera’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cholera) in the
distribution is highlighted in red.

``` r
plot(packageDistribution(package = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-packageDistribution_wed_code-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
plot(packageDistribution(package = "cholera", date = "2020-03-07"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-packageDistribution_sat_code-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

While these plots give us a better picture of where
[‘cholera’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cholera) is located,
comparisons between Wednesday and Saturday are still impressionistic:
all we can confidently say is that the download counts for both days
were greater than the mode.

To facilitate interpretation and comparison, I use the *rank percentile*
of a download count instead of the simple nominal download count. This
nonparametric statistic tells you the percentage of packages that had
fewer downloads. In other words, it gives you the location of your
package relative to the locations of all other packages. More
importantly, by rescaling download counts to lie on the bounded interval
between 0 and 100, rank percentiles make it easier to compare packages
within and across distributions.

For example, we can compare Wednesday (“2020-03-04”) to Saturday
(“2020-03-07”):

``` r
packageRank(package = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04")
>         date packages downloads            rank percentile
> 1 2020-03-04  cholera        38 5,556 of 18,038       67.9
```

On Wednesday, we can see that
[‘cholera’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cholera) had 38
downloads, came in 5,556th place out of the 18,038 different packages
downloaded, and earned a spot in the 68th percentile.

``` r
packageRank(package = "cholera", date = "2020-03-07")
>         date packages downloads            rank percentile
> 1 2020-03-07  cholera        29 3,061 of 15,950         80
```

On Saturday, we can see that
[‘cholera’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cholera) had 29
downloads, came in 3,061st place out of the 15,950 different packages
downloaded, and earned a spot in the 80th percentile.

So contrary to what the nominal counts tell us, one could say that the
interest in [‘cholera’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cholera) was
actually greater on Saturday than on Wednesday.

#### computing rank percentile

To compute rank percentiles, I do the following. For each package, I
tabulate the number of downloads and then compute the percentage of
packages with fewer downloads. Here are the details using
[‘cholera’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cholera) from Wednesday
as an example:

``` r
pkg.rank <- packageRank(packages = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04")

downloads <- pkg.rank$freqtab

round(100 * mean(downloads < downloads["cholera"]), 1)
> [1] 67.9
```

To put it differently:

``` r
(pkgs.with.fewer.downloads <- sum(downloads < downloads["cholera"]))
> [1] 12250

(tot.pkgs <- length(downloads))
> [1] 18038

round(100 * pkgs.with.fewer.downloads / tot.pkgs, 1)
> [1] 67.9
```

#### nominal ranks

In the example above, 38 downloads puts ‘cholera’ in 5,556th place among
18,038 observed packages. This rank is “nominal” because it’s possible
that multiple packages can have the same number of downloads. As a
result, a package’s nominal rank but not its rank percentile can be
affected by its name. For example, because packages with the same number
of downloads are sorted in alphabetical order, ‘cholera’ benefits from
the fact that it is 31st in the list of 263 packages with 38 downloads:

``` r
pkg.rank <- packageRank(packages = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04")
downloads <- pkg.rank$freqtab

which(names(downloads[downloads == 38]) == "cholera")
> [1] 31
length(downloads[downloads == 38])
> [1] 263
```

### visualizing package download rank percentiles

To visualize `packageRank()`, use `plot()`.

``` r
plot(packageRank(packages = "cholera", date = "2020-03-04"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-packageRank_plot_code_wed-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

<br/>

``` r
plot(packageRank(packages = "cholera", date = "2020-03-07"))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-packageRank_plot_code_sat-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

These graphs above, which are customized here to be on the same scale,
plot the *rank order* of packages’ download counts (x-axis) against the
logarithm of those counts (y-axis). It then highlights (in red) a
package’s position in the distribution along with its rank percentile
and download count. In the background, the 75th, 50th and 25th
percentiles are plotted as dotted vertical lines. The package with the
most downloads,
[‘magrittr’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=magrittr) in both cases,
is at top left (in blue). The total number of downloads is at the top
right (in blue).

### III - inflation filters

We compute the number of package downloads by simply counting log
entries. While straightforward, this approach can run into problems.
Putting aside the question of whether package dependencies should be
counted, what I have in mind here is what I believe to be two types of
“invalid” log entries. The first, a software artifact, stems from
entries that are smaller, often orders of magnitude smaller, than a
package’s actual binary or source file. The second, a behavioral
artifact, emerges from efforts to download all of
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). In both cases, a reliance on
nominal counts will give you an inflated sense of the degree of interest
in your package. For those interested, an early but detailed analysis
and discussion of both types of inflation is included as part of this
[R-hub blog
post](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/05/11/packagerank-intro/#inflationary-bias-of-download-counts).

#### software artifacts

When looking at package download logs, the first thing you’ll notice are
wrongly sized log entries. They come in two sizes. The “small” entries
are approximately 500 bytes in size. The “medium” entries are variable
in size: they fall somewhere between a “small” entry and a full download
(i.e., “small” \<= “medium” \<= full download). “Small” entries manifest
themselves as standalone entries, paired with a full download, or as
part of a triplet along side a “medium” and a full download. “Medium”
entries manifest themselves as either standalone entries or as part of a
triplet.

The example below illustrates a triplet:

``` r
packageLog(date = "2020-07-01")[4:6, -(4:6)]

```

The “medium” entry is the first observation (99,622 bytes). The full
download is the second entry (4,161,948 bytes). The “small” entry is the
last observation (536 bytes). At a minimum, what makes a triplet a
triplet (or a pair a pair) is that all members share system
configuration (e.g. IP address, etc.) and have identical or adjacent
time stamps.

To deal with the inflationary effect of “small” entries, I filter out
observations smaller than 1,000 bytes (the smallest package on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) appears to be
[‘source.gist’](https://cran.r-project.org/package=source.gist), which
weighs in at 1,200 bytes). “Medium” entries are harder to handle. I
remove them using either a triplet-specific filter or a filter that
looks up a package’s actual size.

#### behavioral artifacts

While wrongly sized entries are fairly easy to spot, seeing the effect
of efforts to download all of [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
require a change of perspective. While details and further evidence can
be found in the [R-hub blog
post](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/05/11/packagerank-intro/#inflationary-bias-of-download-counts)
mentioned above, I’ll illustrate the problem with the following example:

``` r
packageLog(packages = "cholera", date = "2020-07-31")[8:14, -(4:6)]
```

    >              date     time    size package version country ip_id
    > 132509 2020-07-31 21:03:06 3797776 cholera   0.2.1      US    14
    > 132106 2020-07-31 21:03:07 4285678 cholera   0.4.0      US    14
    > 132347 2020-07-31 21:03:07 4109051 cholera   0.3.0      US    14
    > 133198 2020-07-31 21:03:08 3766514 cholera   0.5.0      US    14
    > 132630 2020-07-31 21:03:09 3764848 cholera   0.5.1      US    14
    > 133078 2020-07-31 21:03:11 4275831 cholera   0.6.0      US    14
    > 132644 2020-07-31 21:03:12 4284609 cholera   0.6.5      US    14

Here, we see that seven different versions of the package were
downloaded as a sequential bloc. A little digging shows that these seven
versions represent *all* versions of ‘cholera’ available on that date:

``` r
packageHistory(package = "cholera")
```

    >   Package Version       Date Repository
    > 1 cholera   0.2.1 2017-08-10    Archive
    > 2 cholera   0.3.0 2018-01-26    Archive
    > 3 cholera   0.4.0 2018-04-01    Archive
    > 4 cholera   0.5.0 2018-07-16    Archive
    > 5 cholera   0.5.1 2018-08-15    Archive
    > 6 cholera   0.6.0 2019-03-08    Archive
    > 7 cholera   0.6.5 2019-06-11    Archive
    > 8 cholera   0.7.0 2019-08-28       CRAN

While there are “legitimate” reasons for downloading past versions
(e.g., research, container-based software distribution, etc.), I’d argue
that examples like the above are “fingerprints” of efforts to download
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). While this is not necessarily
problematic, it does mean that when your package is downloaded as part
of such efforts, that download is more a reflection of an interest in
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) itself (a collection of packages)
than of an interest in your package *per se*. And since one of the uses
of counting package downloads is to assess interest in *your* package,
it may be useful to exclude such entries.

To do so, I try to filter out these entries in two ways. The first
identifies IP addresses that download “too many” packages and then
filters out *campaigns*, large blocs of downloads that occur in (nearly)
alphabetical order. The second looks for campaigns not associated with
“greedy” IP addresses and filters out sequences of past versions
downloaded in a narrowly defined time window.

#### example usage

To get an idea of how inflated your package’s download count may be, use
`filteredDownloads()`. Below are the results for ‘ggplot2’ for 15
September 2021.

``` r
filteredDownloads(package = "ggplot2", date = "2021-09-15")
>         date package downloads filtered.downloads inflation
> 1 2021-09-15 ggplot2    113842              58067     96.05
```

While there were 113,842 nominal downloads, applying all the filters
reduced that number to 57,951, an inflation of 96%.

Note that the filters are computationally demanding. Excluding the time
it takes to download the log file, the filters in the above example take
approximate 75 seconds to run using parallelized code (currently only
available on macOS and Unix) on a 3.1 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5
processor.

There are 5 filters. You can control them using the following arguments
(listed in order of application):

- `ip.filter`: removes campaigns of “greedy” IP addresses.
- `triplet.filter`: reduces triplets to a single observation.
- `small.filter`: removes entries smaller than 1,000 bytes.
- `sequence.filter`: removes blocs of past versions.
- `size.filter`: removes entries smaller than a package’s binary or
  source file.

These filters are off by default (e.g., ip.filter = FALSE). To apply
them, set the argument for the filter you want to TRUE:

``` r
packageRank(package = "cholera", small.filter = TRUE)
```

Alternatively, you can simply set `all.filters = TRUE`.

``` r
packageRank(package = "cholera", all.filters = TRUE)
```

Note that the `all.filters = TRUE` is contextual. Depending on the
function used, you’ll either get the CRAN-specific or the
package-specific set of filters. The former sets `ip.filter = TRUE` and
`size.filter = TRUE`; it works independently of packages at the level of
the entire log. The latter sets `triplet.filter = TRUE`,
`sequence.filter = TRUE` and `size.filter TRUE`; it relies on package
specific information (e.g., size of source or binary file).

Ideally, we’d like to use both sets. However, the package-specific set
is computationally expensive because they need to be applied
individually to all packages in the log, which can involve tens of
thousands of packages. While not unfeasible, currently this takes a long
time. For this reason, when `all.filters = TRUE`, `packageRank()`,
`ipPackage()`, `countryPackage()`, `countryDistribution()` and
`packageDistribution()` use only CRAN specific filters while
`packageLog()`, `packageCountry()`, and `filteredDownloads()` use both
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and package specific filters.

### IV - availability of results

To understand when results become availabble, you need to be aware that
[‘packageRank’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=packageRank) has two
upstream, online dependencies. The first is Posit/RStudio’s [CRAN
package download logs](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/), which record
traffic to the “0-Cloud” mirror at cloud.r-project.org (formerly
Posit/RStudio’s CRAN mirror). The second is Gábor Csárdi’s
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) R package,
which uses those logs to compute the download counts of both the R
application and R packages.

The [CRAN package download logs](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/) for the
*previous* day are typically posted by 17:00 UTC and the results for
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) usually become
available about an hour later.

#### why aren’t today’s logs and results available?

Occasionally problems with “today’s” data can emerge due to the upstream
dependencies illustrated below.

    CRAN Download Logs --> 'cranlogs' --> 'packageRank'

If there’s a problem with the [logs](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/)
(e.g., they’re not posted on time), both
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) and
[‘packageRank’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=packageRank) will be
affected. If this happens, you’ll see things like an unexpected zero
count(s) for your package(s) (actually, you’ll see a zero download count
for all of [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)), data from “yesterday”,
or a “Log is not (yet) on the server” error message.

    'cranlogs' --> packageRank::cranDownloads()

If there’s a problem with
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) but not with
the [logs](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/), only
`packageRank::cranDownalods()` will be affected (the zero downloads
problem). All other
[‘packageRank’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=packageRank)
functions should work since they either directly access the logs or use
some other source. Usually, these errors resolve themselves the next
time the underlying scripts are run (“tomorrow”, if not sooner).

#### `logInfo()`

To check the status of the download logs and ‘cranlogs’, use
`logInfo()`. This function checks whether 1) “today’s” log is posted on
Posit/RStudio’s server and 2) “today’s” results have been computed by
‘cranlogs’.

``` r
logInfo()
```

    $`Today's log/result`
    [1] "2023-02-01"

    $`Today's log posted?`
    [1] "Yes"

    $`Today's results on 'cranlogs'?`
    [1] "No"

    $status
    [1] "Today's log is typically posted by 09:00 PST (01 Feb 17:00 GMT)."

#### time zones

Because you’re typically interested in *today’s* log file, another thing
that affects availability are time zone differences. For example, let’s
say that it’s 09:01 on 01 January 2021 and you want to compute the rank
percentile for [‘ergm’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ergm) for the
last day of 2020. You might be tempted to use the following:

``` r
packageRank(packages = "ergm")
```

However, depending on *where* you make this request, you may not get the
data you expect. In Honolulu, USA, you will. In Sydney, Australia you
won’t. The reason is that you’ve somehow forgotten a key piece of
trivia: Posit/RStudio typically posts *yesterday’s* log around 17:00 UTC
the following day.

The expression works in Honolulu because 09:01 HST on 01 January 2021 is
19:01 UTC 01 January 2021. So the log you want has been available for 2
hours. The expression fails in Sydney because 09:01 AEDT on 01 January
2021 is 31 December 2020 22:00 UTC. The log you want won’t actually be
available for another 19 hours.

To make life a little easier,
[‘packageRank’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=packageRank) does two
things. First, when the log for the date you want is not available (due
to time zone rather than server issues), you’ll just get the last
available log. If you specified a date in the future, you’ll either get
an error message or a warning with an estimate of when the log you want
should be available.

Using the Sydney example and the expression above, you’d get the results
for 30 December 2020:

``` r
packageRank(packages = "ergm")
```

    >         date packages downloads          rank percentile
    > 1 2020-12-30     ergm       292 873 of 20,077       95.6

If you had specified the date, you’d get an additional warning:

``` r
packageRank(packages = "ergm", date = "2021-01-01")
```

    >         date packages downloads          rank percentile
    > 1 2020-12-30     ergm       292 873 of 20,077       95.6

    Warning message:
    2020-12-31 log arrives in appox. 19 hours at 02 Jan 04:00 AEDT. Using last available!

Keep in mind that 17:00 UTC is not a hard deadline. Barring server
issues, the logs are usually posted *before* that time. I don’t know
when the script starts but the posting time seems to be a function of
the number of entries: closer to 17:00 UTC when there are more entries
(e.g., weekdays); before 17:00 UTC when there are fewer entries (e.g.,
weekends). Again, barring server issues, the ‘cranlogs’ results are
usually available shortly *after* 17:00 UTC.

Here’s what you’d see using the Honolulu example:

``` r
logInfo(show.available = TRUE)
```

    $`Today's log/result`
    [1] "2020-12-31"

    $`Today's log posted?`
    [1] "Yes"

    $`Today's results on 'cranlogs'?`
    [1] "Yes"

    $`Available log/result`
    [1] "Posit/RStudio (2020-12-31); 'cranlogs' (2020-12-31)."

    $status
    [1] "Everything OK."

The functions uses your local time zone, which depends on R’s ability to
compute your local time and time zone (e.g., `Sys.time()` and
`Sys.timezone()`). My understanding is that there may be operating
system or platform specific issues that could undermine this ability.

### V - data fix A

The first data fix addresses a problem that affects logs from late 2012
through the beginning of 2013. To understand the problem, we need to be
know that the Posit/RStudio download logs, which begin on 01 October
2012, are stored as separate files with a name/URL that embeds the date:

    http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/2022/2022-01-01.csv.gz

For the logs in question, this convention was broken in three ways: 1)
some logs are effectively duplicated (same log, multiple names), 2) at
least one is mislabeled and 3) the logs from 13 October through 28
December are offset by +3 days (e.g., the file with the name/URL
“2012-12-01” contains the log for “2012-11-28”). As a result, we get
erroneous download counts and we actually lose the last three logs of
2012. Details are available
[here](https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank/blob/master/docs/logs.md).

Unsurprisingly, all this leads to erroneous download counts. What is
surprising is that these errors are compounded by how
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) computes
package downloads.

#### `fixDate_2012()`

[‘packageRank’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=packageRank)
functions like `packageRank()` and `packageLog()` are affected by the
second and third defects (mislabeled and offset logs) because they
access logs via their filename/URL.
[`fixDate_2012()`](https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank/blob/master/R/fixDate_2012.R)
addresses the problem by re-mapping problematic logs so that you get the
log you expect.

#### `fixCranlogs()`

In contrast, while unaffected by the second and third defects functions
that rely on `cranlogs::cran_download()` (e.g.,
[`packageRank::cranDownloads()`](https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank/blob/master/R/cranDownloads.R)\`,
[‘adjustedcranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=adjustedcranlogs)
and [‘dlstats’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dlstats)) are
susceptible to the first defect (duplicate names). My understanding is
that this is because
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) uses the date
in a log rather than the filename/URL to retrieve logs.

To put it differently,
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) can’t detect
multiple instances of logs with the same date. I found 3 logs with
duplicate filename/URLs, and 5 additional instances of overcounting
(including one of tripling).

[`fixCranlogs()`](https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank/blob/master/R/fixCranlogs.R)
addresses this overcounting problem by recomputing the download counts
using the actual log(s) when any of the eight problematic dates are
requested. Details about the 8 days and `fixCranlogs()` can be found
[here](https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank/blob/master/docs/logs.md).

### VI - data fix B

The second data fix addresses a problem of more recent vintage. From
2023-09-13 through 2023-10-02, the download counts for the R application
returned by `cranlogs::cran_downloads(packages = "R")`, is, with two
exceptions, twice what one would expect when looking at the actual
log(s). The two exceptions are: 1) 2023-09-28 where the counts are
identical but for a “rounding error” possibly due to an NA value and 2)
2023-09-30 where there is actually a three-fold difference.

Here are the relevant ratios of counts comparing
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs) results with
counts based on the underlying logs:

        2023-09-12 2023-09-13 2023-09-14 2023-09-15 2023-09-16 2023-09-17 2023-09-18 2023-09-19

Details and code for replication can be found in issue
[\#69](https://github.com/r-hub/cranlogs/issues/69).
[`fixRCranlogs()`](https://github.com/lindbrook/packageRank/blob/master/R/fixRCranlogs.R)
corrects the discrepancies.

Note that there was a similar issue for package download counts around
the same period but that is now fixed in
[‘cranlogs’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cranlogs). For details,
see issue [\#68](https://github.com/r-hub/cranlogs/issues/68)

### VII - et cetera

For those interested in directly using the [Posit/RStudio download
logs](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/), this section describes some issues
that may be of use.

#### country codes (top level domains)

While IP addresses are anonymized, `packageCountry()` and
`countryPackage()` make use of the fact that the logs provide
corresponding ISO country codes or top level domains (e.g., AT, JP, US).
Note that coverage extends to about 85% of observations (i.e.,
approximately 15% country codes are NA). Also, for what it’s worth,
there seems to be a a couple of typos for country codes: “A1” (A +
number one) and “A2” (A + number 2). According to [Posit/RStudio’s
documentation](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/), this coding was done
using MaxMind’s free database, which no longer seems to be available and
may be a bit out of date.

#### memoization

To avoid the bottleneck of downloading multiple log files,
`packageRank()` is currently limited to individual calendar dates. To
reduce the bottleneck of re-downloading logs, which can approach 100 MB,
[‘packageRank’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=packageRank) makes
use of memoization via the
[‘memoise’](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=memoise) package.

Here’s relevant code:

``` r
fetchLog <- function(url) data.table::fread(url)

mfetchLog <- memoise::memoise(fetchLog)

if (RCurl::url.exists(url)) {
  cran_log <- mfetchLog(url)
}

# Note that data.table::fread() relies on R.utils::decompressFile().
```

This means that logs are intelligently cached; those that have already
been downloaded in your current R session will not be downloaded again.

#### timeout

With R 4.0.3, the timeout value for internet connections became more
explicit. Here are the relevant details from that release’s [“New
features”](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html):

    The default value for options("timeout") can be set from environment variable
    R_DEFAULT_INTERNET_TIMEOUT, still defaulting to 60 (seconds) if that is not set
    or invalid.

This change can affect functions that download logs. This is especially
true over slower internet connections or when you’re dealing with large
log files. To fix this, `fetchCranLog()` will, if needed, temporarily
set the timeout to 600 seconds.

#### R Windows Sunday and Wednesday download spikes

The graph above for [R downloads](#packages--r) shows the daily
downloads of the R application broken down by platform (Mac, Source,
Windows). In it, you can see the typical weekly pattern of mid-week
peaks and weekend troughs.

However between 06 November 2022 and 19 March 2023, this was broken. On
Sundays (06 November 2022 - 19 March 2023) and Wednesdays (18 January
2023 - 15 March 2023), there were noticeable, repeated
orders-of-magnitude spikes in the daily downloads of the Windows version
of R.

``` r
plot(cranDownloads("R", from = "2022-10-06", to = "2023-04-14"))
axis(3, at = as.Date("2022-11-06"), labels = "2022-11-06", cex.axis = 2/3, 
  padj = 0.9)
axis(3, at = as.Date("2023-03-19"), labels = "2023-03-19", cex.axis = 2/3, 
  padj = 0.9)
abline(v = as.Date("2022-11-06"), col = "gray", lty = "dotted")
abline(v = as.Date("2023-03-19"), col = "gray", lty = "dotted")
```

![](man/figures/README-sundays-1.png)<!-- -->

These download spikes did not seem to affect either the Mac or Source
versions. I show this in the graphs below. Each plot, which is
individually scaled, breaks down the data in the graph above by day
(Sunday or Wednesday) and platform.

The key thing is to compare the data in the period bounded by vertical
dotted lines with the data before and after. If a Sunday or Wednesday is
orders-of-magnitude unusual, I plot that day with a filled rather than
an empty circle. Only Windows, the final two graphs below, earn this
distinction.
