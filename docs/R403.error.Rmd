## Downloading error

A new feature in R version 4.0.3 appears to _intermittently_ prevent the successful downloading of log files. Reverting to version 4.0.2 is the working solution. The feature in question is the third feature listed in CHANGES IN R 4.0.3:

```
The default value for options("timeout") can be set from environment variable 
R_DEFAULT_INTERNET_TIMEOUT, still defaulting to 60 (seconds) if that is not set 
or invalid.

This may be needed when child R processes are doing downloads, for example 
during the installation of source packages which download jars or other forms of
data.
```

Here's the code for replication.

## Code for URL

```{r error_replication, eval = FALSE}
date <- Sys.Date() - 1
year <- as.POSIXlt(date)$year + 1900
rstudio.url <- "http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/"
log.url <- paste0(rstudio.url, year, '/', date, ".csv.gz")
```

## fread() code to download log file 

The current implementation in 'packageRank' uses the following:

```{r fetch, eval = FALSE}
cran_log <- data.table::fread(log.url)
```

## Base R code to download log file 

The equivalent in base R is:

```{r fetch_base, eval = FALSE}
connection <- gzcon(url(log.url))
dat <- readLines(connection)
cran_log <- read.csv(textConnection(dat))
```

## Error with fread()

```
Error in download.file(input, tmpFile, method = method, mode = "wb", quiet = !showProgress) :
